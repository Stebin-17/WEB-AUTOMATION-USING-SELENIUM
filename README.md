<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

Web automation has become increasingly important in today's fast-paced digital world, enabling businesses and developers to streamline repetitive tasks, perform complex data extraction, and improve overall efficiency. The project "Web Automation using Selenium" aims to leverage the power of Selenium, a widely-used open-source web testing framework, to automate various web-related tasks and interactions.

Selenium allows users to write test scripts in multiple programming languages, such as Python, Java, C#, and Ruby, and supports popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. By using Selenium WebDriver, an API that allows users to control browser actions programmatically, this project will simulate user interactions with websites and automate tasks such as form filling, web scraping, and navigation.The project will focus on creating reusable automation scripts for a diverse range of web applications, ensuring that the developed solution is adaptable to various use cases. This web automation system will not only save time and effort but also reduce the likelihood of human errors in routine tasks, leading to increased productivity and enhanced data accuracy.
